## Features
- Written in C for **Ã¼ltra speed**.
  - No dependencies. Uses sockets for communication with Sway and Linux subsystems.
  - Takes one millisecond on my machine.
- Minimal features:
    - Shows date and time (even seconds!).
    - Shows battery status.
    - Shows keyboard layout. 
    - Shows wifi connection.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo and run:
```bash
make
make install # if you want to have the executable in your path
```

2. Add to your sway config file:
```
bar {
    ...
    status_command sway-musli
    ...
}
```

## Usage
```
Usage: sway-musli [-1|--once]
 - Print a stream of status lines to be used with swaybar.
 - If passed -1 or --once, print once and exit.
 - Example sway config:
    ...
    bar {
        status_command sway-musli
    }
    ...
    # Note: Make sure sway-musli is in your PATH.
```

## Notes
- Assumes your network device is `wlan0`. But you can change this in the source file.
- You can take this as a sample code to help you build your personal **Ã¼ltrafast** Sway status line.
