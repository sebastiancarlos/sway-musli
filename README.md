## Features
- Written in C for **Ã¼ltra speed**.
  - No dependencies. Uses sockets for communication with Sway and Linux
    subsystems.
  - Takes **1ms** to render on my machine.
  - Great performance even when running in **60 FPS mÃ¶de**!
  - Supports both Sway and i3.
    - Easy to adapt to any status bar which supports text input.
- Minimal features:
    - Shows wifi connection.
    - Shows keyboard layout.
    - Shows battery status.
    - Shows date and time (even seconds!).

## Installation
1. Clone the repo and run:
```bash
make
make install # if you want to have the executable in your path
```

2. Add to your Sway/i3 config file:
```
bar {
    ...
    status_command sway-musli
    ...
}
```

## Usage
```
Usage: sway-musli [-1|--once] [-f|--fps <FPS>]
 - Print a stream of status lines to be used with swaybar.
 - If passed -1 or --once, print once and exit.
 - If passed -f or --fps, print at most <FPS> times per second.
   - Default is 30 FPS.
 - Example sway config:
    ...
    bar {
        status_command sway-musli
    }
    ...
    # Note: Make sure sway-musli is in your PATH.
```

## FPS?

That's right. We are in high-performance territory now.

By default, `sway-musli` runs at **30 FPS**, but you can change it with the 
`--fps` option.

- **1 FPS** is completely acceptable, but you might want more if you add some
sort of dynamic content, or if you want to see keyboard layout changes reflected
immediately.
- At around **60 FPS**, your processor might feel a slight tickle. If your bar
is hidden by default, you might as well run it at 60 FPS because Sway/i3 won't
run it while the bar is hidden.

## Notes
- Assumes your network device is `wlan0`. But you can change this in the source
  file.
- You can take this as a sample code to help you build your personal
  **Ã¼ltrafast** Sway status line.
